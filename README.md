# Golf Club Manager

This is a simple golf handicap calculator & auto grading tool that was built to assist my family
in running a small social golf club.

Key functionality includes:
* Add and maintain members
* Record scores per member per game
* Automatically calculates and updates handicap based on the game
* Allows for custom game modes & resultant affect on the handicap
* Requires the user to be logged in to perform most functions
* Automatically creates a list of all members by grade/division (which can be configured)

This was my first Django project completed early January 2016.
